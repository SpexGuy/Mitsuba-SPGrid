This is a brief window into the SPGrid software library. SPGrid
provides a novel data structure that allows manipulation of data on
sparse subsets of uniform grids. This standalone version of SPGrid
contains a few performance and memory allocation tests, just to give
an idea of the capabilities of SPGrid.

To compile, run "make" from a Unix Terminal in this directory. This
generates the "sgprid_demo" executable. To run, simply type:

$ ./spgrid_demo <size> <num_threads>

Where size should be an integer and a power of 2 and num_threads
dictates the number of threads that this program will use. This will
generate an SPGrid data stucture and activate a narrow band of cells,
as well as run a Laplacian stencil on the active cells.

There are also several flags in "main.cpp" which can be turned on to
show various other performance figures:

LOOP_AT_END is simply a flag that will more or less pause the program
with the data structure still intact, such that the user can view the
memory usage using a tool such as "top" (i.e. run "top" from another
terminal).

BLOCKED_COPY runs a SAXPY routine on SPGrid data channels. To observe
performance of these routines, insert timing instructions before
either the Laplace or SAXPY kernel.

DENSE_CUBE will activate the entire grid domain rather than a narrow
band.
